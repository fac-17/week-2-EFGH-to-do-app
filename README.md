## The project

### User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

 &#x2611; enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them  
 &#x2611; view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day  
 &#x2611; mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left  
 &#x2611; the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb  

### Potential stretch goals

As a disorganised person I want to:

 &#x2611; edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes  
 &#x2611; click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off  
 &#x2611; a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing  

### What did we learn?
* To use Test Driven Development on a team project with pair programming
* To use pure functions whenever possible
* To manipulate the DOM using node-lists
* To work with a pre-existing codebase
* To use IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) to protect variables. Note: we didn't write them but they were in the skeleton
* To resolve more complex git issues


### What did we complete?

For the first part of the project we created three functions using TDD. Then, we covered the stretch goals. In total we have the following functions:
1. Add to-do
2. Delete to-do
3. Mark to-do as done
4. Sort to-dos by alphabetical order
5. Edit to-dos using a prompt
